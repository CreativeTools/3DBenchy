# 3DBenchy

\#3DBenchy is a 3D model specifically designed for testing and benchmarking 3D printers. It is a small recognisable object that you can download for free, make and share.

It 3D-prints quickly and is a perfect tool for calibrating your 3D printer. There is a single-part STL file for 3D printing the boat in one material, and a multi-part STL file collection that can be used for multi-material/printhead 3D printing.

The different surfaces of the #3DBenchy model reveal typical issues regarding surface finish, model accuracy, warping, etc.
